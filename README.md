# TypeSocket (Soft Submission)

> A TypeScript-first, type-safe WebSocket library with runtime validation.

## Overview

TypeSocket is a lightweight WebSocket framework built for structured, real-time applications.  
It enforces type safety with TypeScript and optional runtime validation using Zod.

This is a **soft submission / WIP** for Hack This Fall 2025.

## Features (Soft Preview)

- Strong end-to-end TypeScript types
- Runtime validation for events
- Minimal API surface for sending/listening
- Supports custom events

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ragini24-creator/type-socket.git
cd type-socket
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3.Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Connect a client (see demo-client folder) to test events.

Notes

- This is a work in progress — more features, documentation, and examples will follow.

- The repo is public for hackathon access; code will be polished later.
